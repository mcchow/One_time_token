One_time_token generater with
simple CLI
In this assignment you will develop an event based one-time password (OTP) system. 
The system consists of the following components:
1.A soft OTP token UI consistingof a push buttonand a textfield. Clicking on the button will generate and display the one-time password.
2.A test UI which will prompt the user to provide the OTP, show access granted message only if the right OTP is entered.
You will need to do the following:
1.Develop, build and test the UI components.
2.Implement a synchronization mechanism if the two apps get out of sync.
[Optional â€“1%bonus]3.Perform Collision Resistance analysis on the OTP generation algorithm.
Use the following algorithm to generate the OTPs:Feedback One-Time Password Algorithm(FOTP)Hash Feedback One-Time Password Algorithmdescribed in the following chart.
Secret key is used as the initialization vector.
The first OTP is generated by hashing this vector.
The second OTP is generated by hashing the hash generated by the first the 1stOTP, and so on.
TheOTP is calculated by  truncating  the  hash  into  a  six  digit hexadecimal value.
The  lest  significant  hex  digits  will  be extracted as the OTP.

1.Complete source code and screen captures of the running program.
2.A study of the collision property. Generate 1,000,000 OTPs using your application. Show a graph describing how the collision propertyevolvesas the number of OTPs increases.
3.A video recording showing a full demo of your apprication.
